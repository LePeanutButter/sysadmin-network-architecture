# Network Packet Captures (PCAP Files)

This directory contains Wireshark packet capture files collected during a network connectivity verification process. The captures were analyzed to validate communication between devices, address resolution mechanisms, and correct switch operation within the local network.

## Capture Overview

- **Total packets captured:** 30
- **Capture tool:** Wireshark
- **Purpose:** Network connectivity verification and protocol analysis

The captured traffic includes:

- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** requests and replies
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** echo requests and replies (ping)
- **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)** control frames generated by a Cisco switch

These packets provide evidence of correct network operation, stability, and reliability.

## Packet Types Observed

### 1. ARP Packets (Address Resolution Protocol)

ARP packets were captured primarily for resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses within the local network.

- **ARP Requests**

  - Sent as broadcast frames
  - Destination MAC address: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`
  - Example:

    ```
    Who has 183.24.50.1? Tell 183.24.50.105
    ```

- **ARP Replies**

  - Sent as unicast frames
  - Example:

    ```
    183.24.50.105 is at 30:13:8b:6a:19:46
    ```

This analysis allows the association of IP addresses with their corresponding MAC addresses and demonstrates the dynamic address resolution process in the local network.

### 2. ICMP Packets (Ping Request and Reply)

ICMP packets correspond to echo requests and echo replies exchanged between hosts:

- **Source IP:** 183.24.50.105
- **Destination IP:** 183.24.50.106

Each ICMP packet includes:

- Identifier
- Sequence number
- Time To Live (TTL)

By comparing request and reply packets, it is possible to:

- Verify end-to-end connectivity
- Measure round-trip time (RTT)
- Detect packet loss

This confirms successful communication between the devices and correlates IP addresses with MAC addresses previously resolved via ARP.

### 3. STP Packets (Spanning Tree Protocol)

STP packets were generated by a Cisco switch identified as:

- **Device:** Cisco_0d:c9:82

These packets contain topology control information, including:

- Root Bridge ID
- Path cost
- Port information

STP frames do not carry user data. Instead, they ensure loop prevention and determine the optimal network topology by selecting a root bridge and calculating the best paths between switches.

## Packet List and Frame Analysis

The Wireshark **Packet List** view displays:

- Packet number
- Timestamp
- Source and destination addresses
- Protocol type
- Packet length
- Brief protocol information

This view enables identification of traffic patterns such as:

- ARP broadcast frames
- ICMP echo exchanges
- STP control messages

Each packet can be further analyzed at the Ethernet frame level, revealing:

- Destination and source MAC addresses (unicast or broadcast)
- Encapsulated protocol (ARP, IP, STP, etc.)
- Payload data
- Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for error detection

The **Bytes View** provides a hexadecimal representation of each frame, allowing verification of packet structure and integrity.
